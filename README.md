# CNC Milling Machine Anomaly Detection, Maintenance Prediction, and Health Monitoring

This project aims to develop an AI-driven system for CNC milling machine anomaly detection, classification, maintenance prediction, and health detection. By leveraging machine learning models, the system provides real-time monitoring through a dashboard where users can check whether a particular CNC machine is facing anomalies, the type of anomaly, future maintenance plans, and its overall health status.

## Project Overview

The system uses multiple machine learning models, each tailored for specific tasks:

- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses **Isolation Forest** to identify whether a machine is operating outside its normal parameters based on historical data.
- **Anomaly Type Classification**: **Random Forest** is used to classify different types of detected anomalies.
- **Maintenance Prediction**: **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)** is employed to predict future maintenance needs, especially considering the time-series nature of the data.
- **Machine Health Score**: **Random Forest Regressor** is used to estimate the overall health of a CNC machine based on various operational parameters.

Additionally, the project includes a web dashboard to visualize predictions and maintenance alerts.

## Key Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies anomalies in real-time using over 1,500 data samples.
- **Anomaly Classification**: Categorizes the detected anomalies using Random Forest.
- **Maintenance Forecast**: Predicts when maintenance is required using LSTM to analyze time-series data.
- **Health Monitoring**: Provides a health score of the machine, which helps in predicting the machine's performance and lifespan.
- **Web Dashboard**: Built with React.js to display live predictions and updates.
- **Real-time Data Simulation**: The backend simulates real-time data every minute, mimicking input from CNC machines.
- **Data Storage**: Predictions and sensor data are stored in a PostgreSQL database for future analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **AI Models**:
  - Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest
  - Anomaly Type Classification: Random Forest

## Model Training

The models were trained on a dataset consisting of the following feature columns:

```python
feature_columns = [
    'vibration_rms', 'motor_temp_C', 'spindle_current_A', 'rpm',
    'tool_usage_min', 'coolant_temp_C', 'cutting_force_N',
    'power_consumption_W', 'acoustic_level_dB', 'machine_hours_today',
    'total_machine_hours', 'vibration_trend', 'motor_temp_trend',
    'power_efficiency', 'tool_wear_rate', 'vibration_std_24h',
    'temp_rate_change', 'current_stability', 'hour', 'day_of_week'
]
```

- **Anomaly Detection**: The **Isolation Forest** model was trained with over 1,500 data samples.
- **Anomaly Classification**: **Random Forest** was used to categorize detected anomalies.
- **Maintenance Prediction**: **LSTM** was used for predicting maintenance schedules based on time-series data.
- **Machine Health Score**: **Random Forest Regressor** was employed to assess the health of the machine.

## Workflow

1. **Data Simulation**: Every minute, the backend simulates incoming data using a scheduler in Python, mimicking real-world sensor data.
2. **Model Predictions**: The Flask backend loads the trained models and makes predictions for the incoming data. These predictions are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
3. **Frontend Display**: The React.js dashboard fetches the data from the database and displays:
   - Anomaly detection status
   - Anomaly classification (type)
   - Future maintenance predictions
   - Current machine health score
